# rainfall-prediction
Rainfall prediction using machine learning involves analyzing historical weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) to build models that forecast precipitation. Algorithms like Random Forest, LSTM, and Gradient Boosting are trained to predict rainfall intensity or occurrence, aiding agriculture, water management.
